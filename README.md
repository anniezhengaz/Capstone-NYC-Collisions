## Project Overview


## Data Overview & Business Goal
This project utilizes a dataset from [NYC OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95) website with data received from the New York Police Department (NYPD). With nearly two million rows of collisions spanning from 2012 to 2023 within all five boroughs, the dataset provide additional information including location, number of injuries and casualities, contributing factors and vehicle types. 

This analysis focused on the two NYC boroughs with the highest populations - Queens and Brooklyn with only collisions that occured within the last five years, 2018 to 2023. The target variable in the analysis was 'Contributing Factor Vehicle 1' which laid a foundation for the rest of the analysis and modeling. The goal of this analysis to identify the leading factors in collisions and recommend the actions that could mitigate or prevent future collisions.
